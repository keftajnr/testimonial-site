                    an amazing experience here. I signed up for the 
                    free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                    I enrolled shortly thereafter. Thee next 12 weeks 
                    was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully 
                    switched careers, working as a Software Engineer

                        line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
                         who can help me learn programming step by step. 
                         I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of 
                         theirs who can only say wonderful things about the 
                         program. The entire curriculum and staff did not 
                         disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
                         had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                         project, in particular, was outstanding. It took 
                         my learning to the next level in a way that no 
                         tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred 
                         to it during interviews as an example of my development 
                         experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a 
                         full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
